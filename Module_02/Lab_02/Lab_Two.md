# Lab TWO

## Hooking up to your local GUI

So- before we get started with Snowflake let's get it hooked up to our local system! 
There are numerous ways to interface with snowflake. The obvious (read: default) way to create interactions is through the WEB GUI interface which you probably created in the initial set up lab:

![snowflakescreen](./images/snowflakescreen.png)

_However_: we have options!

### CHALLENGE ONE: Hook up a local client to SNOWFLAKE (about 30 minutes):

IF you have any of the following GUIs locally please take the next 10 minutes to see if you can get hooked up with them. 
For most of the class we will be utilizing the web GUI (the default method) but the following local clients also work:

* [Datagrip](https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip/) by Jetbrains. This is my preferred method because you can have one GUI that hooks up to Postgresql, Mysql, MSSQL, Snowflake, Hadoop, Redshift, etc.

* [SQLWorkbench](https://support.snowflake.net/s/article/configuring-sql-workbenchj-to-use-snowflake): Will need the JDBC driver

* [DBeaver](https://www.cdata.com/kb/tech/snowflake-jdbc-dbvr.rst) for which you will also need a JDBC driver

## USER MANAGEMENT

Okay- so first off.. congratulations to everyone for becoming DBAs! Welcome to the most thankless, angry job in the world:

![angrydba](./images/angrydba.jpg)

One of the biggest parts of the DBA job is to manage **users**. With Snowflake this is pretty easy but we'll want to go through it to make sure that everyone is managed effectively.

Snowflake comes with several Pre-defined roles. They are:

* **ACCOUNTADMIN:** (aka Account Administrator)
  * Role that encapsulates the SYSADMIN and SECURITYADMIN system-defined roles. It is the top-level role in the system and should be granted only to a limited/controlled number of users in your account.

* **SECURITYADMIN:** (aka Security Administrator)
  
  * Role that can monitor, and manage users and roles. More specifically, this role is used to:

  * Modify and monitor any user, role, or session.

  * Modify any grant, including revoking it.

* **USERADMIN:** (aka User and Role Administrator)

  * Role that can create users and roles. More specifically, this role is used to:

  * Create users and roles in your account (and grant those privileges to other roles).

* **SYSADMIN:** (aka System Administrator)

  * Role that has privileges to create warehouses and databases (and other objects) in an account.

  * If, as recommended, you create a role hierarchy that ultimately assigns all custom roles to the SYSADMIN role, this role also has the ability to grant privileges on warehouses, databases, and other objects to other roles.

* **PUBLIC:**

  * Pseudo-role that is automatically granted to every user and every role in your account. The PUBLIC role can own securable objects, just like any other role; however, the objects owned by the role are, by definition, available to every other user and role in your account.

  * This role is typically used in cases where explicit access control is not needed and all users are viewed as equal with regard to their access rights.

![system-role-hierarchy](./images/system-role-hierarchy.png)

SO...let's start with creating a basic user! Let's check the user menu. ON THE GUI:

* Click on the **SNOWFLAKE_SAMPLE_DATA** Database and return to a menu that has a SQL Entry GUI (you can also click on SNOWFLAKE logo in the top left hand corner to get here):

![snowflakelogo](./images/snowflakelogo.png)

* Now utilizing this code we can effectively create a user:

```
CREATE USER practicefern password='somepass' default_role = public must_change_password = true;
```

SO...go in and try to run that code. Let's see what comes back....

![insufficient](./images/insufficient.png)

Wait, WTF?

![wtf](./images/wtf.jpeg)

SO...as it turns out we don't currently have sufficient permissions to run that user. That must be rectified quickly.
In order to do this let's update our permissions to allow it. To do this we need to look at updating our **ROLE**

So to do this we need to upgrade our role. 
Let's take a quick look at what our role IS:

`SELECT current_role()`

Now- remember from our lecture portion how the users permissions work. Considering that:

### CHALLENGE TWO: UPDATE YOUR ROLE SO THAT YOU CAN RUN THE CREATE USER COMMAND


Snowflakeâ€™s approach to access control combines aspects from both of the following models:

* **Discretionary Access Control (DAC):** Each object has an owner, who can in turn grant access to that object.

* **Role-based Access Control (RBAC):** Access privileges are assigned to roles, which are in turn assigned to users.

## Creating Warehouses

As we went over in the first section of our lecture portion- WAREHOUSES are the highest level of data storage arena that you have available in snowflake. 
Fortunately they are DEAD EASY to create BUT...you have to remember how the system works. 
Not just **anyone** can create a deathstar...er....warehouse. 

![palpatine](./images/palpatine.jpeg)

SO FIRST we must become the sith Lord himself with:
`USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN`

Go ahead and put that into your snowflake GUI. 
NOW we are ready to build our death star. Go ahead and create the warehouse with this very simple command:

`CREATE WAREHOUSE deathstar WAREHOUSE_SIZE=XSMALL`

Assuming that that was successful you should be able to run `SHOW WAREHOUSES` and see DEATHSTAR is now a warehouse.
Excellent. Now let the hate flow through you for a while before we move on to the next step.

![hateflowthroughyou](./images/hateflowthroughyou.jpeg)

Okay...so now we have a WAREHOUSE...the next thing that we'll want to do is have a **database** to operate **within** that warehouse. Easy enough but FIRST we _must_ remember to USE deathstar so please make sure we:

`USE WAREHOUSE deathstar`

Followed by...

`CREATE DATABASE throneroom`

Excellent! Okay...so we have our WAREHOUSE. We have our DATABASE WITHIN that warehouse now let's start creating users!

## Managing Users

So- as we've gone over in the lab- one of the first things we need to do when setting up a new SNOWFLAKE system is to create a user with a LOT of permissions (but not ALL of the permissions). As a quick reminder- these are the default roles:

* ACCOUNTADMIN
* SECURITYADMIN
* SYSADMIN
* PUBLIC

Now- the important thing to note here is that the **PUBLIC** role is more like a pseudorole that really doesn't do anything. It's basically DEFAULT. 

SO...let's get a look at our roles with the simple command: `SHOW ROLES`. Run that now. 
You should see a table listing the generic roles. Fine. Let's create a role now. 

Run `CREATE ROLE "darth_vader"`;

IF you run into issues with permissions allowing you to create the role you will need to upgrade YOUR user's role to `ACCOUNTADMIN`. Go ahead and make that happen.

NOW...we have four options (kind of think of them as "templates") that we can make this role part of. Let's do

`GRANT ROLE "darth_vader" to ROLE "SECURITYADMIN"`

### CHALLENGE THREE: WHY ARE WE USING SECURITYADMIN HERE? WHAT DOES THIS ROLE ACCOMPLISH??

You've just handed over power. 

![power](./images/power.jpeg)

Okay...let's make sure that this role appears in our list. 
Run `SHOW ROLES` again. 
Ideally you should see your darth_vader role there.

![vader](./images/vader.jpeg)

Okay...so now we've created a role...we need to add privileges to him! So which of these powers should we grant to Darth?

SO...let's go ahead and add some privileges to our role. The first thing we want ot do with this is to allow our new role to **operate** on our warehouse.

Basically- we want darth to be pretty powerful sooo....

`GRANT operate ON warehouse deathstar to role darth_vader`

AND let's give his ROLE privileges on our PUBLIC schema so...

`GRANT ALL ON DATABASE throneroom to role darth_vader`

`GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA throneroom.public to ROLE darth_vader`

OKAY! Awesome! So now we have our ROLE defined.
So remember from the lecture portion that Snowflake is very ROLE based and not USER based (which is different)

Before we go on let's take a look at the summary here! IF you find yourself getting lost here you can always run `SHOW GRANTS TO ROLE darth_vader` (go ahead and do this now)

ALSO if you want to get a look at the ROLE situations with any objects in the hierarchy you can run this to find now (do it now):

`SHOW GRANTS ON DATABASE throneroom`

NOW let's go on and create a USER and assign them to the role. Another nice thing about SNOWFLAKE is that the commands are pretty straightforward...so let's take a look at one:

`CREATE USER lukeskywalker PASSWORD='tatooinerocks' DEFAULT_ROLE = "public";`

![skywalker](./images/skywalker.jpeg)

Now we want to grant our new user LUKE some serious power. Let's give him the role of DARTH VADER (this was the emperor's plan so let's bring it to fruition):

`GRANT ROLE darth_vader TO USER lukeskywalker`

WAIT! NO!!! HE'S GOING TO BETRAY US!!

`REVOKE ROLE darth_vader FROM USER lukeskywalker`

Meh. Let's trust him again...

`GRANT ROLE darth_vader TO USER lukeskywalker`

AND let's check to make sure that we have successfully updated the user:

`SHOW GRANTS TO USER lukeskywalker`

Did you get that he now has DARTH_VADER powers?

Now that you have successfully crushed the rebellion it's time to remove everything we've done. Fortunately, again, Snowflake makes this pretty easy. Let's go through and run each of these:

```sql
DROP DATABASE throneroom
DROP ROLE darth_vader
DROP USER lukeskywalker
DROP WAREHOUSE deathstar 

```

Damn. Rebels win again...

### CHALLENGE FOUR: CREATE A NEW WAREHOUSE, DATABASE, AND SCHEMA. CREATE A ROLE THAT HAS SELECT AND INSERT PERMISSIONS ON THAT SCHEMA. SHOW ALL OF THE GRANTS THAT YOU HAVE ON THESE OBJECTS. SEND COMMANDS TO INSTRUCTOR WHEN DONE ON CHAT
